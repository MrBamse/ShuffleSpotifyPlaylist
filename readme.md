# Spotify Playlist Shuffler

## Why?

Google Home devices won't shuffle playlists when setting a media alarm.

Waking up to the same song every day will drive you nuts.

So here. Have a separate computer do the shuffling for you.

## Requirements

 - [A Spotify application in your developer account with a defined Redirect URI (it doesn't need to resolve)](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings)
 - Python 3.x
 - [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)

## Usage

In your config.cfg, enter in the appropriate fields:

- Your app's Client ID
- Client Secret 
- Redirect URI 
- Spotify ID of the playlist you want to be randomized. Make sure you have write access on your account for that playlist. 

For example:

| Link format | Playlist ID |
|--|--|
| spotify:playlist:**37i9dQZF1DXbB7yFaZiAQX** | 37i9dQZF1DXbB7yFaZiAQX  |
| https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXbB7yFaZiAQX?si=WuwjFrBFQLemt62oixgPgA | 37i9dQZF1DXbB7yFaZiAQX  |

On its first run, you will be required to open a link generated by the script and paste the resulting URL back into the terminal. Don't worry if the result is unreachable, just paste it back in.

An authorization token will be placed in the script's folder. No further interaction is needed.
